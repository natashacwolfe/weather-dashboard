## Purpose

The weather dashboard was an assignment to make a web app that uses an API. 

## What I accomplished

It was a rewarding challange to extract certain data from the API AJAX call, and manipulate the dom to display the data. It was great to see how the last few weeks of class have really added up to being able to create this responsive web app. I completed the JavaScript portion a bit early and was able to play with flexbox for my layout rather than using Bootstrap.
